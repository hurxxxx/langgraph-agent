# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Agent Supervisor System

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a multi-agent supervisor system built using LangGraph and OpenAPI. The system will orchestrate various specialized agents to perform complex tasks, with the supervisor managing communication flow, task delegation, and decision-making.

## Date
May 9, 2025

## Version
1.0

## Project Goals
- Create a flexible, extensible multi-agent system with a supervisor architecture
- Support both streaming and non-streaming responses
- Implement specialized agents for various tasks
- Ensure easy integration of new agents
- Document all APIs and libraries used for future reference

## Technical Requirements

### Core Architecture
1. **Supervisor Agent**
   - Orchestrate communication between specialized agents
   - Delegate tasks based on user prompts
   - Analyze prompts to automatically identify parallelizable tasks
   - Support parallel processing for independent tasks (e.g., web search and vector search)
   - Process multiple search topics in parallel when identified in a single query
   - Implement human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms
   - Handle both streaming and non-streaming responses

2. **Agent Framework**
   - Use latest LangGraph/LangChain libraries (as of May 2025)
   - Implement OpenAPI specifications for all agents
   - Support asynchronous operations
   - Provide standardized input/output interfaces

3. **Response Handling**
   - Support streaming responses for real-time feedback
   - Support standard (non-streaming) responses
   - Implement proper error handling and recovery

### Specialized Agents

1. **Search Agents**
   - Implement integrations with:
     - Serper
     - Google Search
     - DuckDuckGo
     - Tavily

2. **SQL RAG Agents**
   - Support for:
     - PostgreSQL (local instance with credentials: ID: postgres, PW: 102938)
     - SQLite
     - Other SQL databases as needed
   - Create complex schema structures for testing
   - Generate or import substantial sample data for comprehensive testing
   - Support for importing external database samples

3. **Vector Storage Agents**
   - Implement integrations with:
     - Chroma
     - Qdrant
     - Milvus
     - pgvector (using local PostgreSQL instance with credentials: ID: postgres, PW: 102938)
     - Meilisearch
   - Use OpenAI's embedding-small model for generating vector embeddings
   - Configure and set up PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
   - Create necessary database users and permissions
   - Implement vector database creation and management

4. **Vector Retrieval Agent**
   - Efficient retrieval from vector stores
   - Use OpenAI's embedding-small model for query embeddings
   - Support for hybrid search strategies
   - Implement semantic similarity search

5. **Reranking Agent**
   - Implement reranking with:
     - Cohere Rerank
     - Pinecone
     - Other reranking services

6. **Image Generation Agent**
   - Support for:
     - DALL-E
     - GPT-4o image generation API
     - Other image generation services
   - Save generated images as local files for verification
   - Implement testing mechanisms to verify image generation
   - Support various image formats and resolutions

7. **Document Generation Agents**
   - Implement specialized agents for various document types:
     - Report Writer Agent: For formal reports and summaries
     - Blog Writer Agent: For engaging blog posts and articles
     - Academic Writer Agent: For research papers and academic documents
     - Proposal Writer Agent: For business proposals and pitches
     - Planning Document Agent: For project plans and specifications
   - Content generation and refinement
   - Support for different writing styles and formats
   - Implement templates for various document types
   - Support for citations and references where appropriate

8. **MCP (Master Control Program) Agent**
   - High-level orchestration and planning
   - Strategic decision-making

9. **Quality Measurement Agent**
   - Evaluate response quality
   - Provide metrics and feedback

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Code Structure**
   - Modular design with clear separation of concerns
   - Well-documented interfaces between components
   - Consistent error handling
   - Comprehensive logging

2. **Documentation**
   - Detailed API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Learning resources directory with latest API usage information
   - Library version information and compatibility notes

3. **Configuration**
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Secure API key management
   - Feature toggles for different agent capabilities

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for individual agents
   - Integration tests for agent interactions
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows

## Success Criteria
- All specialized agents successfully implemented and integrated
- Supervisor can effectively delegate tasks to appropriate agents
- System supports both streaming and non-streaming responses
- New agents can be easily added to the system
- Comprehensive documentation available for all components
- Human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms working correctly

## Future Enhancements
