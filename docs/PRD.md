# Product Requirements Document: Multi-Agent Supervisor System

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a multi-agent supervisor system built using LangGraph and OpenAPI. The system will orchestrate various specialized agents to perform complex tasks, with the supervisor managing communication flow, task delegation, and decision-making.

## Date
May 9, 2025

## Version
1.0

## Project Goals
- Create a flexible, extensible multi-agent system with a supervisor architecture
- Support both streaming and non-streaming responses
- Implement specialized agents for various tasks
- Ensure easy integration of new agents
- Document all APIs and libraries used for future reference

## Technical Requirements

### Core Architecture
1. **Supervisor Agent**
   - Orchestrate communication between specialized agents
   - Delegate tasks based on user prompts
   - Support parallel processing when appropriate
   - Implement human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms
   - Handle both streaming and non-streaming responses

2. **Agent Framework**
   - Use latest LangGraph/LangChain libraries (as of May 2025)
   - Implement OpenAPI specifications for all agents
   - Support asynchronous operations
   - Provide standardized input/output interfaces

3. **Response Handling**
   - Support streaming responses for real-time feedback
   - Support standard (non-streaming) responses
   - Implement proper error handling and recovery

### Specialized Agents

1. **Search Agents**
   - Implement integrations with:
     - Serper
     - Google Search
     - DuckDuckGo
     - Tavily

2. **SQL RAG Agents**
   - Support for:
     - PostgreSQL
     - SQLite
     - Other SQL databases as needed

3. **Vector Storage Agents**
   - Implement integrations with:
     - Chroma
     - Qdrant
     - Milvus
     - pgvector
     - Meilisearch

4. **Vector Retrieval Agent**
   - Efficient retrieval from vector stores
   - Support for hybrid search strategies

5. **Reranking Agent**
   - Implement reranking with:
     - Cohere Rerank
     - Pinecone
     - Other reranking services

6. **Image Generation Agent**
   - Support for:
     - DALL-E
     - GPT-4o image generation API
     - Other image generation services

7. **Writer Agent**
   - Content generation and refinement
   - Support for different writing styles and formats

8. **MCP (Master Control Program) Agent**
   - High-level orchestration and planning
   - Strategic decision-making

9. **Quality Measurement Agent**
   - Evaluate response quality
   - Provide metrics and feedback

## Implementation Requirements

1. **Code Structure**
   - Modular design with clear separation of concerns
   - Well-documented interfaces between components
   - Consistent error handling
   - Comprehensive logging

2. **Documentation**
   - Detailed API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Learning resources directory with latest API usage information
   - Library version information and compatibility notes

3. **Configuration**
   - Environment-based configuration
   - Secure API key management
   - Feature toggles for different agent capabilities

4. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for individual agents
   - Integration tests for agent interactions
   - End-to-end tests for complete workflows

## Success Criteria
- All specialized agents successfully implemented and integrated
- Supervisor can effectively delegate tasks to appropriate agents
- System supports both streaming and non-streaming responses
- New agents can be easily added to the system
- Comprehensive documentation available for all components
- Human-in-the-loop feedback mechanisms working correctly

## Future Enhancements
- Additional specialized agents
- Enhanced parallelization capabilities
- Improved human-in-the-loop interfaces
- Performance optimizations
- Extended monitoring and analytics
