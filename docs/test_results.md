# Test Results: Multi-Agent Supervisor with Serper Integration

This document records the results of testing the multi-agent supervisor system with real API keys and real-world queries.

## Date
May 9, 2025

## Test Environment
- Python 3.10
- LangGraph 0.3.0
- LangChain 0.1.0
- OpenAI API (GPT-4o model)
- Serper API for search functionality

## Test Cases

### 1. Supervisor with Serper Search Integration

#### Test Script: `tests/test_supervisor_serper.py`

This test script verifies the supervisor agent's ability to delegate tasks to the search agent using Serper for web search.

**Test Queries:**
1. "What is LangGraph?"
2. "Tell me about the latest developments in AI in 2025"
3. "Who won the 2024 Olympics?"

**Results:**
- All test queries were processed successfully
- The search agent correctly retrieved relevant information using the Serper API
- The supervisor agent properly delegated the tasks to the search agent
- Response times were reasonable (6-35 seconds per query)
- The responses were coherent and informative

### 2. Real-World Queries with Serper Integration

#### Test Script: Modified `examples/basic_usage.py`

This test script uses the multi-agent supervisor system with Serper integration to process real-world queries.

**Test Queries:**
1. "What are the latest advancements in quantum computing?"
2. "What is the current state of climate change research?"
3. "How do large language models like GPT-4 work?"
4. "Generate an image of a futuristic city with flying cars." (Image generation test)

**Results:**
- All search queries were processed successfully using the Serper API
- The search agent retrieved relevant and up-to-date information
- The responses were well-structured and informative
- The image generation query was handled correctly, although using a mock implementation

## Observations

### Strengths
1. **Accurate Search Results**: The Serper API provided relevant and accurate search results for all queries.
2. **Coherent Responses**: The supervisor agent generated coherent and informative responses based on the search results.
3. **Proper Delegation**: The supervisor correctly identified which agent to use for each query.
4. **Error Handling**: The system handled potential errors gracefully, with appropriate fallback mechanisms.

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Response Time**: Some queries took up to 35 seconds to process. Optimization could improve response times.
2. **Streaming Implementation**: The current streaming implementation doesn't provide true streaming functionality. It returns the final state with `stream=True` rather than streaming chunks of the response.
3. **Mock Implementations**: Some components (like the image generation agent) are using mock implementations. These should be replaced with real implementations when ready.

## Next Steps
1. **Optimize Agent Performance**: Implement caching and other optimization techniques to improve response times.
2. **Enhance Streaming Support**: Implement true streaming functionality for real-time updates.
3. **Implement Additional Agents**: Proceed with implementing the SQL RAG agent, vector retrieval agent, and other planned agents.
4. **Create Unit Tests**: Develop comprehensive unit tests for all components.

## Conclusion
The multi-agent supervisor system with Serper integration is functioning as expected. The search agent successfully retrieves relevant information using the Serper API, and the supervisor agent properly delegates tasks and synthesizes coherent responses. The system is ready for further development and optimization.
