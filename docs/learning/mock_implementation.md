# Mock Implementation for Development and Testing

This document explains the mock implementation used for development and testing of the multi-agent supervisor system without requiring API keys.

## Overview

The multi-agent supervisor system is designed to work with various external services, including:

- OpenAI API for language models
- Serper API for web search
- Vector databases for document storage
- Image generation services

To facilitate development and testing without requiring API keys for these services, the system includes mock implementations that simulate the behavior of these services.

## Mock LLM Implementation

The system includes a mock implementation of language models that can be used when the OpenAI API key is not available:

```python
class MockLLM:
    def invoke(self, messages):
        # Extract query from messages
        query = ""
        for msg in messages:
            if isinstance(msg, dict) and msg.get("role") == "user":
                query = msg.get("content", "")
            elif hasattr(msg, "content"):
                if getattr(msg, "role", "") == "user":
                    query = msg.content
        
        # Simple logic to determine response based on query
        if "search" in query.lower() or "find" in query.lower():
            return {"content": "I'll use the search_agent to find information about this."}
        elif "image" in query.lower() or "picture" in query.lower():
            return {"content": "I'll use the image_generation_agent to create an image."}
        elif "store" in query.lower() or "save" in query.lower():
            return {"content": "I'll use the vector_storage_agent to store this information."}
        elif "quality" in query.lower() or "evaluate" in query.lower():
            return {"content": "I'll use the quality_agent to evaluate this."}
        else:
            return {"content": "I'll handle this query directly. " + query}
```

## Mock Search Implementation

The system includes a mock implementation of search services that can be used when the Serper API key is not available:

```python
class MockSearchTool:
    def invoke(self, query):
        return [f"Mock search result for: {query}"]
```

## Mock Vector Storage Implementation

The system includes a mock implementation of vector storage services that can be used when vector database connections are not available:

```python
class MockVectorStore:
    def add_documents(self, documents):
        return [f"doc_{i}" for i in range(len(documents))]
    
    def delete(self, ids):
        return True
    
    def persist(self):
        return True
```

## Mock Image Generation Implementation

The system includes a mock implementation of image generation services that can be used when the DALL-E API key is not available:

```python
def generate_image_dalle(self, prompt: str):
    # This is a mock implementation
    image_url = "https://example.com/generated_image.png"
    
    return ImageGenerationResult(
        image_url=image_url,
        prompt=prompt,
        model="dall-e-3",
        size="1024x1024"
    )
```

## Using Mock Implementations

The system automatically falls back to mock implementations when API keys are not available. This is done using try-except blocks that catch exceptions when initializing the real implementations and fall back to the mock implementations.

For example:

```python
try:
    self.llm = ChatOpenAI(
        model=config.llm_model,
        temperature=config.temperature,
        streaming=config.streaming
    )
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Warning: Could not initialize ChatOpenAI: {str(e)}")
    # Use a mock implementation
    self.llm = MockLLM()
```

## Benefits of Mock Implementations

Using mock implementations provides several benefits:

1. **Development without API keys**: Developers can work on the system without needing API keys for external services.
2. **Testing without API costs**: Tests can be run without incurring costs for API calls.
3. **Offline development**: Development can continue even when internet access is limited or unavailable.
4. **Predictable responses**: Mock implementations provide predictable responses, which can be useful for testing specific scenarios.

## Limitations of Mock Implementations

Mock implementations have some limitations:

1. **Limited functionality**: Mock implementations provide only basic functionality compared to the real services.
2. **Simplified responses**: Responses from mock implementations are simplified and may not reflect the complexity of real responses.
3. **No real-world data**: Mock implementations do not provide access to real-world data, which may be important for some use cases.

## Conclusion

Mock implementations are a valuable tool for development and testing, but they should not be used in production environments where real functionality is required. When deploying the system to production, ensure that all necessary API keys are provided and that the system is configured to use the real implementations.
