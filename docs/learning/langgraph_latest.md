# LangGraph Latest Information (as of May 2025)

## Overview
LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It provides a framework for creating complex workflows and agent systems with clear control flow and state management.

## Latest Version
As of May 2025, the latest version of LangGraph is 0.3.x, which introduced prebuilt agents and enhanced supervisor capabilities.

## Key Features

### Functional API
Introduced in January 2025, the Functional API provides a more intuitive way to define LangGraph workflows. It allows for:
- More declarative workflow definitions
- Easier composition of complex workflows
- Better type checking and IDE support
- Simplified streaming implementation

### Streaming Support
LangGraph has first-class support for streaming, allowing for:
- Real-time updates from agents
- Progressive rendering of responses
- Improved user experience for long-running tasks

### Multi-Agent Architecture
LangGraph supports various multi-agent architectures:
1. **Supervisor Architecture**: A central agent controls all communication and delegates tasks
2. **Tool-Calling Supervisor**: Specialized agents are represented as tools for the supervisor
3. **Peer-to-Peer**: Agents communicate directly with each other
4. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Incorporates human feedback into the agent workflow

## Core Concepts

### Graphs
Graphs define the flow of information between nodes (agents or functions) in a LangGraph application.

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated

# Define state
class State(TypedDict):
    messages: list[dict]
    current_agent: str

# Create graph
graph = StateGraph(State)

# Add nodes
graph.add_node("agent_1", agent_1_function)
graph.add_node("agent_2", agent_2_function)

# Define edges
graph.add_edge("agent_1", "agent_2")

# Compile
app = graph.compile()
```

### State Management
LangGraph provides robust state management capabilities:
- Typed state definitions
- Immutable state updates
- State history tracking
- Checkpointing and resumption

### Prebuilt Agents
LangGraph 0.3 introduced prebuilt agents for common use cases:
- Assistant agents
- Tool-using agents
- Supervisor agents
- Custom agent creation

## Integration with LangChain

LangGraph is designed to work seamlessly with LangChain components:
- LangChain tools can be used directly in LangGraph nodes
- LangChain chains can be incorporated as nodes
- LangChain retrievers can be used for RAG applications

## Best Practices

### Supervisor Implementation
For implementing a supervisor agent:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from langgraph.prebuilt import SupervisorAgent
from typing import TypedDict, List, Dict, Any

class AgentState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    next_agent: str

# Create supervisor
supervisor = SupervisorAgent.from_llm(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0),
    agents={"search": search_agent, "writer": writer_agent},
    tools=[tool1, tool2]
)

# Create graph
graph = StateGraph(AgentState)
graph.add_node("supervisor", supervisor)
graph.add_node("search", search_agent)
graph.add_node("writer", writer_agent)

# Add conditional edges
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "supervisor",
    lambda state: state["next_agent"]
)

# Add edges back to supervisor
graph.add_edge("search", "supervisor")
graph.add_edge("writer", "supervisor")

# Set entry point
graph.set_entry_point("supervisor")

# Compile
app = graph.compile()
```

### Streaming Implementation

```python
# Create a streaming app
app_streaming = graph.compile(streaming=True)

# Use the app with streaming
for chunk in app_streaming.stream({"messages": [user_message]}):
    print(chunk)  # Process each chunk as it arrives
```
