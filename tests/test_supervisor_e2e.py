"""
End-to-End tests for the Multi-Agent Supervisor System.

This module contains end-to-end tests that verify the supervisor's ability to:
1. Analyze complex user prompts
2. Create detailed execution plans
3. Delegate tasks to appropriate agents
4. Monitor task execution and adapt as needed
5. Integrate results from multiple agents
6. Deliver coherent final responses

These tests use more realistic scenarios and verify the complete flow from user prompt to final response.
